              can be fine or of medium length, the most common color being white

              e.g. brown, blue, blackbird, red and tricolor. Adult males are
              about 53cm; females slightly less.

          There are millions of abandoned dogs on the streets around the world,
          and combating this alarming phenomenon seems to be a daunting task,
          especially because of the easy breeding of dogs and the
          irresponsibility of many people. Dogs are taken to shelters due to
          overcrowding, while those who remain on the streets lead a life of
          fear, hunger, cold and physical abuse. Adopting a stray dog will save
          their lives, giving them a second chance to have a home and live a
          dignified and happy life. Also, if you have enough free space, you
          should also get a second dog to complete a perfect family. Several
          studies have shown the positive effect that a dog has on human health.
          Not only is it proven that those children who come in contact with an
          animal will develop the necessary defenses against allergies, but it
          is also known that this coexistence with an animal can improve your
          cardiovascular health, help fight stress and relax you. <br />So let's
          save some lives!

            Eventually, you will need to visit the veterinary office, whether
            you are doing a routine check-up, vaccination, or because your pet
            is sick or injured. The trip to the vet's office can be a stressful
            experience for your dog. Many unfamiliar views, sounds, smells,
            people and animals. But there are a few things you can do to make
            this experience comfortable and stress-free. Dogs need to be taken
            care of!

            Dry food is an economical food for dogs. Unlike wet food, it can be
            stored more easily, helps maintain the dog's dental health, provides
            a regular stool and the cost, per serving, is lower. Before choosing
            a type of dry food for your dog, we recommend that you read the
            ingredients of the products carefully and make sure that the
            manufacturer uses quality raw materials in their composition.

            Play helps build a trusting relationship with your pet, but at the
            same time encourages exercise - in short, it is an essential part of
            any dog's life! The zooplus selection of dog toys helps you easily
            initiate games with your four-legged friend and keep him alert and
            in good physical shape. From toys to stimulate intelligence or
            movement, to chewing articles or funny stuffed animals.
